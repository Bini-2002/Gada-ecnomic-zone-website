Four heavy-duty transformers, each weighing 66 tons and capable of producing 50MW—totaling a combined capacity of 200MW arrived safely today at the Gada Special Economic Zone (GSEZ) substation. Scheduled to begin power generation by July 2025, these transformers will provide dedicated electricity to support GSEZ investors. The substation itself is equipped with a 230/33KVA capacity, reinforcing the zone’s infrastructure.
