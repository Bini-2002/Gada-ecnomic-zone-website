Gada Special Economic Zone (GSEZ) proudly took part in the prestigious “Invest in Ethiopia” High-Level Business Forum, held at the Skylight Hotel in Addis Ababa. The event was graced by the presence of H.E. President Ambassador Taye Atskeselassie, along with a distinguished assembly of international investors, high-level dignitaries, and prominent guests from both within Ethiopia and abroad.

The forum provided a strategic platform for GSEZ to showcase its investment potential and strategic vision to a global audience. Our exhibition attracted considerable interest from attendees, fostering meaningful dialogue and networking opportunities. We found the event to be both inspiring and invigorating, reaffirming our commitment to advancing sustainable investment and economic transformation through GSEZ.
