Industry SectorsEthiopia’s industrial sector is projected to expand by approximately 12 percent in 2024/25, demonstrating tangible progress under the “Ethiopia Tamirt” initiative. National production capacity, previously at 59 percent, has now risen to 65 percent, primarily due to increased factory utilization. Industrial energy demand has surged to 40 percent, reflecting accelerated industrial activity. Notable sectoral gains include an 18 percent increase in steel production and substantial expansion in cement output. Efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in glass manufacturing are also underway, with a state-of-the-art glass factory—designed to produce 600,000 tons annually—scheduled for completion by December or January. Additionally, solar panel manufacturing plants are under construction and set to be inaugurated soon, reinforcing the country’s commitment to revitalizing and modernizing its industrial base. Our Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed said, “For Ethiopia to become competent in the global economic arena, leveraging on manufacturing industry is crucial. In this regard, the establishment of Gada Special Economic Zone (GSEZ) is instrumental in unlocking Oromia’s and Ethiopia’s vast potential for manufacturing industry.”Hence, GSEZ stands out as a leading initiative driving the industrial transformation of our nation. Come and build your future in GSEZ!
