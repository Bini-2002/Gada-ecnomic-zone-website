The Gada Special Economic Zone, which was established with the hope of bringing about economic transformation in the country, is focusing on creating job opportunities, generating foreign exchange, import substitution and increasing exports. Many companies are moving to enter development with the zone and those who have obtained permits and entered construction are showing good progress. The Special Economic Zone Proclamation, laws encouraging investment and economic reforms such as foreign exchange reforms being carried out by the government are creating positive incentives to attract and encourage investors.
Accordingly, a lease agreement was signed between the Gada Special Economic Zone Development Corporation (GSEZDC) and the National Cement Share Company, which is expected to play a major role in solving the cement supply problem in the country. This strategic partnership is a 50-year long-term partnership. Under the agreement, National Cement Share Company has been entrusted to operate a cement grinding unit in the Zone. The facility will be planted on 20 hectares of land with a production capacity of 5 million tones per annum and will play an important role in bringing industrial development to the country. In addition, the plant will operate in a pollution-free manner and is estimated to generate more than 2,000 job opportunities for the local community.
